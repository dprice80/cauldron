# Plan
##Â in cli.py
- [x] Change all hard coded links to /pipelines//
- [x] OR add a function to create /pipelines/ when initiating the first project
- [x] Decide whether projects will be simply added to projects folder when creating a new project (probably should warn)
- [x] MLOPS_PIPELINES_IMAGE_TAG is hard coded to europe-west2-docker.pkg.dev
- [x] Do I need to change functions in cli to private functions? (not done)
- [ ] Allow using service account
